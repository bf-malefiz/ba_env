**2. Defining a Kedro Pipeline**

Next, define a Kedro pipeline for your model training and evaluation workflow. This pipeline should include nodes for:

* Loading and preprocessing data.
* Initializing and training your Bayesian model.
* Generating predictions and evaluating performance metrics.
* Logging results to MLflow.


**5. Extending the Framework**

You can extend the framework by adding custom models, evaluation metrics, or visualization tools. See the documentation for more details.


This is just an example, and you can customize it to fit your specific needs and use cases. Remember to use reStructuredText syntax for formatting and include code blocks, images, and other elements as needed to make your tutorial clear and engaging.
